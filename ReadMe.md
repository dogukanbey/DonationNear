The contract is located in under the ***contract/assembly*** folders, after editing the contract you can run

    yarn build:release

    yarn deploy-contract
This will create a test account and deploy the contract into it.

after the contract is deployed, it is necessary to run the following command in the terminal in order to be able to run the contract


    set CONTRACT=ACCOUNT_ID
